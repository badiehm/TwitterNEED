TwitterNEED
============

We offer two twitter datasets that are mainly designed for named entity extraction (NEE) and disambiguation (NED) tasks.

-The first set is mainly created by and annotated for NEE [1]. We did the annotations for NED. Each NE is assigned to one appropriate entity page. We gave higher priority to Wikipedia pages. If Wikipedia has no page for the entity we link it to a home page or profile page. The dataset composed of four subsets of tweets; one public timeline subset and four subsets of targeted tweets revolves around economic recession, Australian Bushfiresand and gas explosion in Bozeman, MT.

-The other dataset is the one used in [2] which is relatively small in size of tweets but rich in number of NE.

Statistics about the two data sets are shown in the following table:

                      1st Dataset     2nd Dataset                 

#Tweets                   1603        162
#Mentions                 1585        510
#Wiki Entities            1233(78%)   483(94%)
#Non-Wiki Entities        274(17%)    19(4%)
#Mentions with no Entity  78(5%)      8(2%)
